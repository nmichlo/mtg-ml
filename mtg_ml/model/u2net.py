#    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
#    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
#    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
#    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
#
#    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
#    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
#    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
#    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
#    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
#    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
#    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
#
#    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

#
#    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
#    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

#
# 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
#    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
#    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
#    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
#
# 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
#    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
#    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
#    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
#    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
#    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
#    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
#    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
#    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
#    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
#    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
#    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
#    as of the date such litigation is filed.
#
# 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
#    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
#    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
#    meet the following conditions:
#
#    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
#        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
#
#    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
#        stating that You changed the files; and
#
#    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
#        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
#        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
#        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
#        the Derivative Works; and
#
#    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
#        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
#        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
#        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
#        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
#        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
#        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
#        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
#        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
#        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
#        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
#        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
#        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
#        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
#        as modifying the License.
#
#    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
#    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
#    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#    the conditions stated in this License.
#
# 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
#    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
#    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
#    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
#    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
#    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
#
# 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
#    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
#    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
#    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
#
# 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
#    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
#    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
#    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
#    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
#    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
#    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
#    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
#    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
#
# 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
#    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
#
# 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
#    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
#    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
